1.	How many markets sell items that are not edible? First, I need to exclude all exclude all markets that are located in a city that has the same name as the county it's located in. To this, I did the following:
a.	First, insert a new column on the far left
b.	Insert a function that states: =IF(F4=G4,TRUE,FALSE) where F4 = city and G4 = County. And drag down for the whole column.
c.	Drag the function down the list of the excel sheet
d.	This will mark all matching cities and counties as true.
e.	To remove all items marked as true, do the following (not solely my work, found source and modified):
Highlight Column A. Hit Alt+F11 to bring up the VBA. Insert new module and copy the following in:
Sub DeleteZeroRow()
'Updateby20140616
Dim Rng As Range
Dim WorkRng As Range
On Error Resume Next
xTitleId = "KutoolsforExcel"
Set WorkRng = Application.Selection
Set WorkRng = Application.InputBox("Range", xTitleId, WorkRng.Address, Type:=8)
Application.ScreenUpdating = False
Do
    Set Rng = WorkRng.Find("True", LookIn:=xlValues)
    If Not Rng Is Nothing Then
        Rng.EntireRow.Delete
    End If
Loop While Not Rng Is Nothing
Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
Click Run.
This will remove all rows that have a matching city and county.
To find markets that sell items that are not edible, I did the following:
1.	Highlight whole table and create pivot table
2.	Select Market Name for row, and add in non-edible items. Not sure what snap and a few others were, so I assumed non-edible as the following
a.	Trees
b.	Nursery
c.	Soap
d.	Plants
e.	Crafts
f.	Maple
g.	Flowers
2.	I found the following: The number of markets that sell at least 1 edible item as stated above, is 3341. The number of markets that sell ALL of the non-edible items mentioned above is 78.
2.	How many farmers markets could you visit in your home state where you could acquire all of the necessary ingredients to make your favorite meal?
My favorite meal is very simple, and consists of Poultry, vegetables, and herbs: Stir Fry!
So in my pivot table, I made Market name the row, and added in Poultry, vegetables and herbs as a filter, as well as State – Washington. This give me 58 unique farmers markets in Washington that I can get all needed ingredients for my favorite meal.
3.	How many markets are within the Oregon Territory area?
If the Oregon Territory, is only Oregon, then I would just continue using my pivot table to filter state – Oregon which equates to 157.
Not knowing exactly what was meant by Oregon Territory, I googled that and found it used to consist of current day Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Using that, there are 358 unique markets.
4.	What is one unique fact or pattern about farmers markets in the United States that you can recognize using the raw data?
A few conclusions I can draw from the data:
•	32% of the markets operate on Federal/state grounds, 23% are co-located with Wholesale markets, and 20% are with educational institutions.
